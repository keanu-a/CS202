The goal of this project is to:
  - Familiarize students with developing projecets which contain multiple files.
  - Introduce students to using makefiles
  - Use C++ skills like File IO, Standard IO, string and vector library
  
Instructions:
Write a program for analyzing text loaded from a file.

The name of the text file should be provided as a command line argument. If a filename is not provided
then an error message should be displayed. If a filename was provided, the program will read words from the file
while storing the word into a vector.
